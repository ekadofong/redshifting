Usage:

Basic Usage:
1) In terminal, run (one directory up from directory with the name of the mask that contains lots of *sum.fits files)
        cubs_redhisfting.py -m MASKNAME (-v cosmos)
    The COSMOS and CarPy pipelines produce slightly different output formats--defaults to reading in CarPy, use -v cosmos if using COSMOS output.
    This should make a new directory (MASKNAME_spec1D) where spectra reformatted for this program and redshift data are stored.
2) For each object
    - press 'M' to mask wavelengths at x>5000, x<9800, and the A band (~7600). These can be unmasked, but they are often very noisy, have bad flux calibration, and can mislead the PCA/chi-2 fitting.
    - press 'r' to determine the best fitting redshift.
    - press 'a/s/d/f' to assigned a quality of (a)wesome=2, (s)ingle-line=1, (d)amn=0, or (f)'ed=-1
    - If the extraction is bad (or maybe if there are 2 objects) tick the corresponding checkbox.
3) If the initial redshifting didn't work, you can:
    -mask/unmask regions of the spectrum with 'm' and 'u'. Cosmic rays will often need to be masked--CarPy does a weighted sum and attempts to filter out cosmics, but isn't always successful at that, especailly around dense skylines regions.
    -Choose a different redshift in the 'redshift' plot at the top with 'z', then run a local redshift minimization with 'l'
    -Identify specific lines with [1-9] and [!-%] (see redshift assignment keys below)
    -Zoom in and look for emission lines in the 2D--I often pull up the spectrum in ds9 to help with this since I'm better at using the scaling in that. (The 2D spectrum is called specname_sum.fits for CarPy output.)
